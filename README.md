, resumes and etc.) in form of QR's , We will provide the users to fill in the informations and convert them in QR's for saving offline or keeping it againts their profile for
information sharings, contrary from creating a QR the user will be given the option of reading a QR from either of the two ways uploading a QR or Scanning through cameras.

> ##* WHERE WE SEE IT's USES *##
* In many of small talks or interactions we want to share our contact or social informations we can use the applications to share the information QR very quickly and easliy.

* For patients it is difficult to maintain the all the records and history of their medical diagnosis , once uploaded on the QR it is very effective to carry such informations
and records.

* For Sensitive informations such as banking and property related informations sharing via QR codes gives the security of not transcating the data directly over the internet.

> ##* FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS* ##

* Enhance the User experience and add the information on how to use the application within itself without going through exhasutive docs.
* Add for templates for QR Creation(Currently We have only 3 in contact, Medical and Resume).
